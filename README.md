# My_Data_Structure_Staque

I Create a data structure called “Staque” which can store only integers. 

The way Staque works is as follows:

If the number that you are trying to store in the Staque is even, it is pushed in front of the Staque

If the number that you are trying to store in the Staque is odd, it is pushed at the end of the Staque

When you try to remove a number from the Staque, it always do it from either the front or from the back of the Staque following the LIFO rule.
